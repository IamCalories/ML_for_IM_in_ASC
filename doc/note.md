# Some note about my research

## Feedback from prof. Wang  (2020.04.16)
1. Our scenario is not complex enough that RL will saturate. Try complex scenario.  
- Study paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8868117 to see the different.  
- "RL saturate" ? Increase self throughtput will interfer with others.  

2. The paper mentioned above have some questions  
- Prove that DRL is actually close to the upper bound.
- Is the upper bound correct or not ?

3. Using APC to control inter-cell interference and using RL to control intra-cell interference.
